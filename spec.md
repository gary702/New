# Project Specification

## 1. Background & Problem

**What's the problem?**
Currently, we lack proper product and feature documentation across all our products. While our teams iterate rapidly with weekly sprints, there’s no centralized and continuously updated reference that captures the latest product logic, user flows, API interactions, or feature behaviors. This makes it difficult for new team members, developers, PMs, and stakeholders to understand the product context or refer to the latest updates without relying on ad-hoc discussions.

**Who has this problem?**

1. Product Managers, who need to maintain clarity on product scope and communicate updates efficiently across teams.

2. Developers, who require consistent references for implementation and validation of feature changes.

3. QA & CX teams, who need to understand expected behaviors to test or explain product functions correctly.

4. New team members, who struggle to onboard quickly due to missing or outdated documentation.

**Current situation:**
At present, documentation is often fragmented across tickets, chat threads, and meeting notes. As we iterate quickly every week, information about new changes or feature improvements becomes outdated almost immediately after release. Without a structured documentation process tied to our sprint cadence, we risk losing product knowledge over time, causing inconsistencies in execution, support, and decision-making.

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

**Primary Goal:**
To establish a structured and sustainable documentation framework that evolves alongside our 1-week sprint cycle — ensuring every product and feature has an up-to-date, single-source-of-truth document that reflects the latest implementation, logic, and outcomes.

**Success looks like:**

- 100% of newly released features have a corresponding documentation entry within 3 days after release.
- Existing feature docs are updated in sync with sprint completions (minimum once every 2 weeks).
- Reduction in repetitive clarifications or misalignment issues reported by Dev / QA / CX teams.
- Improved onboarding efficiency measured by new PM or Dev time-to-context (target: < 2 days).

## 3. Project Overview

**Project Name:**
Product Documentation & Release Note

**Description:**
To document about the product / feature logics and how to. Additionally to keep track of what are the changes and when they're being made

**Target Users:**
Primarily PM, Devs, Tech Leads

## 4. What It Should Do

### Core Features

- [ ] Users should be able to automatically generate the product / feature documentations based on the proposed or implemented changes (including logics or BE or BE efforts)
- [ ] It will show well-documented change logs of the product and feature

### User Actions

1. User can create product documentations from created tickets
2. User can create release change logs
3. When deployments have been made, the app should automatically generate those documents and information

## 5. How It Should Look

**Visual Style:** Minimal, but modern

**Colors:** A clean and simple palette with a white background, black text, and a single accent color (e.g., a cool blue) for interactive elements.

**Layout:** A responsive layout with a sidebar for navigation (listing products and features) and a main content area to display the documentation.

### Key Pages/Sections

- **Page/Section 1:** **Dashboard/Home:** A central page that provides an overview of recently updated documents and a search bar for quickly finding specific documentation.
- **Page/Section 2:** **Documentation Page:** A page that displays the content of a specific product or feature document, including its history of changes.

## 6. Technical Requirements

**Deployment:** Netlify or Vercel (choose one or let AI recommend)

**Works on:** Both computers and mobile phones

**Data Storage:** Yes, data needs to be saved. The system will store product documentation, feature details, and change logs. This data should persist even after the browser is closed.

**Note:** You don't need to choose specific technologies (like React, HTML, etc.). The AI will help you choose based on your project needs. Just focus on describing WHAT you want to build.

## 7. Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1:** A developer wants to understand a feature.

- User opens the app and sees the Dashboard.
- User uses the search bar to find documentation for "Feature X".
- The app displays a list of matching documents, and the user clicks on the most relevant one.
- The app shows the detailed documentation for "Feature X", including the latest changes.

**Scenario 2:** A Product Manager documents a new feature.

- A Product Manager wants to document a new feature that was just deployed.
- The user clicks on "Create New Document".
- The user fills in the details of the new feature (e.g., from a Jira ticket).
- The user saves the document.
- The system creates a new documentation page for the feature and it now appears in the list of documents.

## 8. Content & Copy

**Key Headlines:**

- **Main headline:** Product Documentation Hub
- **Subheadline:** Your single source of truth for product and feature information.

**Call-to-Action Buttons:**

- **Primary CTA text:** Create New Document
- **Secondary CTA text:** View Recent Changes

**Other Important Text:**

- **Welcome message:** Welcome! Find the documentation you need or create a new entry.

**Out of Scope (Not Included):**

- User authentication and permissions.
- Real-time collaboration on documents.
- Direct integration with ticketing systems (e.g., Jira, GitHub) for fully automated documentation generation.
